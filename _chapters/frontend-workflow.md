description: There are three steps that are a part of workflow for a Create React App configured with Netlify. To work on new features create a new branch and enable branch deployments. And merge to master to deploy to production. Finally, publish an old deployment through the Netlify console to rollback in production.

Now that we have our frontend deployed and configured, let's go over what our development workflow will look like.

### Working in a Dev Branch

A good practise is to create a branch when we are working on something new.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Run the following in the root of your project.

``` bash
$ git checkout -b "new-feature"
```

This creates a new branch for us called `new-feature`.

Let's make a faulty commit just so we can go over the process of rolling back as well.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace the `renderLander` method in `src/containers/Home.js` with the following.

``` coffee
renderLander() {
  return (
    <div className="lander">
      <h1>Scratch</h1>
      <p>A very expensive note taking app</p>
      <div>
        <Link to="/login" className="btn btn-info btn-lg">
          Login
        </Link>
        <Link to="/signup" className="btn btn-success btn-lg">
          Signup
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And commit this change to Git.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Committing a typo"
```

### Create a Branch Deployment

To be able to preview this change in its own environment we need to turn on branch deployments in Netlify. From the **Site settings** sidebar select **Build & deploy**.

![Select Build & deploy screenshot](/assets/part2/select-build-and-deploy.png)

And hit **Edit settings**.

![Edit build settings screenshot](/assets/part2/edit-build-settings.png)

Set **Branch deploys** to **All** and hit **Save**.

![Set branch deploys to all screenshot](/assets/part2/set-branch-deploys-to-all.png)

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Now comes the fun part, we can deploy this to dev so we can test it right away. All we need to do is push it to Git.

``` bash
$ git push -u origin new-feature
```

Now if you hop over to your Netlify project page; you'll see a new branch deploy in action. Wait for it to complete and click on it.

![Click on new branch deploy screenshot](/assets/part2/click-on-new-branch-deploy.png)

Hit **Preview deploy**.

![Preview new branch deploy screenshot](/assets/part2/preview-new-branch-deploy.png)

And you can see a new version of your app in action!

![Preview deploy in action screenshot](/assets/part2/preview-deploy-in-action.png)

You can test around this version of our frontend app. It is connected to the dev version of our backend API. The idea is that we can test and play around with the changes here without affecting our production users.

### Push to Production

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Now if we feel happy with the changes we can push this to production just by merging to master.

``` bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge new-feature
$ git push
```

You should see this deployment in action in Netlify.

![Production deploy after merge screenshot](/assets/part2/production-deploy-after-merge.png)

And once it is done, your changes should be live!

![Production deploy is live screenshot](/assets/part2/production-deploy-is-live.png)

### Rolling Back in Production

Now for some reason if we aren't happy with the build in production, we can rollback.

Click on the older production deployment.

![Click on old production deployment screenshot](/assets/part2/click-on-old-production-deployment.png)

And hit **Publish deploy**.

![Publish old production deployment screenshot](/assets/part2/publish-old-production-deployment.png)

This will publish our previous version again.

And that's it! Now you have an automated workflow for building and deploying your Create React App with serverless.

### Cleanup

Let's quickly cleanup our changes.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace the `renderLander` method in `src/containers/Home.js` with the original.

``` coffee
renderLander() {
  return (
    <div className="lander">
      <h1>Scratch</h1>
      <p>A simple note taking app</p>
      <div>
        <Link to="/login" className="btn btn-info btn-lg">
          Login
        </Link>
        <Link to="/signup" className="btn btn-success btn-lg">
          Signup
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Commit these changes and push them by running the following.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Fixing a typo"
$ git push
```

This will create a new deployment to live! Let's wrap up the guide next.
